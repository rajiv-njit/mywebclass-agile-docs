As a website owner, I want to create a privacy policy that complies with GDPR requirements, so that users understand how their personal data is collected, processed, and stored.

Acceptance Criteria:
* The privacy policy clearly and concisely explains what personal data is collected, processed, and stored by the website.
* The privacy policy includes information about the legal basis for processing personal data, such as consent or legitimate interest.
* The privacy policy includes information about the purpose for processing personal data, such as providing services or marketing.
* The privacy policy includes information about the categories of personal data collected, such as name, email, or IP address.
* The privacy policy includes information about how long personal data is stored, and how it is securely stored and protected.
* The privacy policy includes information about how users can exercise their rights under GDPR, such as the right to access, rectify, or erase their personal data.
* The privacy policy is easily accessible from the website, such as in the footer or in a dedicated privacy policy page.
