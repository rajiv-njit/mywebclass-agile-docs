As a developer, I want to configure the CI server to automatically build and test the website code so that I can ensure the website is functional and free of errors.

Acceptance Criteria:

The CI server is configured to build the website code automatically whenever changes are pushed to the code repository.
The build process includes steps to compile the code and generate the website files.
The build process includes automated tests to check the functionality and performance of the website.
The automated tests are configured to run automatically after each build.
If any tests fail, the CI server notifies the development team so that they can address the issues.
The build process is documented and can be repeated for future code changes.
