Title of the Epic: Set up Continuous Integration (CI) for the MyWebClass website

Description: This epic aims to set up a continuous integration (CI) process for the MyWebClass website, which will enable automated building, testing, and deployment of the website code.

Goals: [Implement a CI process that automatically builds and tests the website code whenever changes are made to the codebase
Ensure that the CI process is reliable, fast, and easy to use
Reduce the risk of errors and bugs in the website code by catching them early in the development process
Increase the speed and efficiency of the development process by automating manual tasks and reducing the need for manual testing and deployment

User Stories:
[As a developer, I want to set up a CI server for the MyWebClass website
As a developer, I want to configure the CI server to automatically build and test the website code
As a developer, I want to integrate the CI process with the code repository so that changes trigger the build and test process
As a developer, I want to set up automated deployment of the website code to a staging server for testing and review]

Dependencies:
[Availability of a suitable CI server and software tools
Availability of suitable hosting and deployment infrastructure for the staging server]

Risks:
[Technical issues during setup and configuration of the CI process
Integration issues with the code repository and hosting infrastructure
Reliability and stability of the CI process]

Estimated Effort: [40-60 hours]

Business Value:

Increase the speed and efficiency of the development process by automating manual tasks and reducing the need for manual testing and deployment
Improve the quality and reliability of the website code by catching errors and bugs early in the development process
Reduce the risk of downtime and other issues caused by faulty code deployments
Priority: High
