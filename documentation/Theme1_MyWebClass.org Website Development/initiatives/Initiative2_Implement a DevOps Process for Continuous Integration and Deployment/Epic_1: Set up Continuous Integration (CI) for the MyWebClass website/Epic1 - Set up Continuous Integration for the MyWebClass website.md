Title of the Epic: Set up Continuous Integration (CI) for the MyWebClass website

Description: This epic aims to set up a continuous integration (CI) process for the MyWebClass website, which will enable automated building, testing, and deployment of the website code.

Goals: 
* Implement a CI process that automatically builds and tests the website code whenever changes are made to the codebase
* Ensure that the CI process is reliable, fast, and easy to use
* Reduce the risk of errors and bugs in the website code by catching them early in the development process
* Increase the speed and efficiency of the development process by automating manual tasks and reducing the need for manual testing and deployment

User Stories:
* As a developer, I want to set up a CI server for the MyWebClass website

Dependencies:
* Availability of a suitable CI server and software tools
* Availability of suitable hosting and deployment infrastructure for the staging server

Risks:
* Technical issues during setup and configuration of the CI process
* Integration issues with the code repository and hosting infrastructure
* Reliability and stability of the CI process

Estimated Effort: 40 hours

Business Value:
* Increase the speed and efficiency of the development process by automating manual tasks and reducing the need for manual testing and deployment
* Improve the quality and reliability of the website code by catching errors and bugs early in the development process
* Reduce the risk of downtime and other issues caused by faulty code deployments

Priority: High
