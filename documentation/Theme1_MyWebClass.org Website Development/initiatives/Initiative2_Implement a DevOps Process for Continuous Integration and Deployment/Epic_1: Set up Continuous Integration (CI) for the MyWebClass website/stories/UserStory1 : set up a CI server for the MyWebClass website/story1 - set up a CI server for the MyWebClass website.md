As a developer, I want to set up a CI server for the MyWebClass website so that code changes can be automatically tested and deployed.

Acceptance Criteria:

A CI server is installed and configured for the MyWebClass website.
The CI server is connected to the code repository and can detect code changes.
The CI server runs automated tests on the code changes to ensure they pass.
If the automated tests pass, the CI server automatically deploys the code changes to the production server.
If the automated tests fail, the CI server notifies the development team so that they can address the issues.
The entire process is documented and can be repeated for future code changes.
