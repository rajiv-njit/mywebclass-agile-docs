As a developer, I want to set up a CI server for the MyWebClass website so that code changes can be automatically tested and deployed.

Acceptance Criteria:
* A CI server is installed and configured for the MyWebClass website.
* The CI server is connected to the code repository and can detect code changes.
* The CI server runs automated tests on the code changes to ensure they pass.
* If the automated tests pass, the CI server automatically deploys the code changes to the production server.
* If the automated tests fail, the CI server notifies the development team so that they can address the issues.
* The entire process is documented and can be repeated for future code changes.
